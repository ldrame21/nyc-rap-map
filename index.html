            As done by Moretti for the 19th century neighborhoods of London, a cartography of a city as it is depicted through litterature can teach us a lot about the feelings and connotations associated to it. In Morretti’s case, it allows him to notice a strong difference between the real London, crumbling under poverty and crime, and the one described in contemporary novels. Moretti’s study allowed him to map feelings associated to given places at given times. By applying a methodology similar to his’ to a 21th century topic of interest, with new tools and approaches, we were hoping to visually represent …  . In our case the city to cartography therefore became New York, as for the literature and novels, they became rap lyrics.
            <!--
                <strong>MeToo</strong>. Two words, a hashtag, a civil rights movement with tremendous impacts on our
            society. Everything starts on October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017, with a viral Twitter hashtag from Alyssa
            Milano. The movement, initially created by Tarana Burke, spread all over the world, inviting women to break
            silence on sexual harassment, violence, discrimination via social networks. The medias stepped in with
            widespread coverage and enhanced the movement's influence. Finally, women inequalities and the unsafe
            climate created by actors of society became a trending and polarizing topic on all media. Still, the
            question of the size of MeToo's impact outside the realm of social media is to be answered. By using the
            Quotebank <sup><a href=" #_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup> dataset from 2015 to 2020, we will
            investigate the significance of the movement's impact. -->

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            <em>
              “There are some who dismiss hip-hop as the dead letter of brazen stereotype-mongering among the severely
              undereducated and their gaggle of learned and over-interpreting defenders. Other critics claim that the
              deficits of hip-hop are amplified because they blare beyond the borders of ugly art to inspire youth to
              even uglier behavior. And others protest that, stripped of politics, history, and racial conscience,
              hip-hop is little more than sonic pathology that blasts away all the achievement of the civil rights
              struggle.”
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Born between Harlem and the Bronx around the 70s from a mix of different cultures and art forms, hip hop is
            surprisingly rarely considered as a subject of scholarly studies. Indeed, since its apparition rap has often
            been criticized for corrupting the younger generations by twisting their ideals. By considering the inherent
            negativity of the genre as the translation of a harsh environment and understanding it in close relation to
            a context, we can understand rap as a mirror of the society. This is reflected in the speed at which it
            evolves and reacts to events of the actuality. It thus makes sense to use its lyrics as a reservoir from
            which to draw information specific to decades and boroughs.
          </p>
          <p>
            For his study mentionned above, Moretti proceeded to a large survey of sentiments associated with precise
            locations within London. All of his data was drawn from 15’000 lines of various types of books, written
            between 1’700 and 1’900. These were then associated to a score ranging from -1 to 1, with -1 being very
            negative to 1 being very positive.
            Basing our methodology on Moretti’s, we exchanged the books for a dataset constructed using lyrics from
            about a hundred of New York City’s hip hop artists. In the latter, artificial paragraphs consisting of three
            consecutive “lines” of their lyrics were created, in order to increase their contextualization and reduce
            false interpretations. We then proceeded to keep only the paragraphs which mentionned a place in New York
            City, resulting in a dataset containing a total of 3’200 paragraph.

            Topic Extraction
          </h3>
          <p>
            The chart presented above is a topic model created using TFidf. It was made to explore the different topics
            addressed in New Yorker rap lyrics in relation with different factors. The lyrics lines we started from were
            separated by lines, we therefore had to find a way to artificially create the different corpuses with
            specially distinct topics required to perform topic modelling using TFidf.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our first step was to separate the lines per neighborhood, in hopes that clusters describing New York
            boroughs would appear. The results were unfortunately not concluding as we couldn’t see nor understand any
            logic within the clusters. A probable explanation for this is that the topics of larger interest were
            recurrent in most of the neighborhoods, making them disappear through the TFidf method.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The last and final step consisted of creating two main corpuses, each separated in five sub-corpuses. The
            first of the main corpuses contained lines related to New York City in general as well as the most famous
            locations in the city, such as Broadway or SoHo. The second main corpus aggregated lyrics precisely
            describing NYC neighborhoods, respectively the Bronx, Harlem, the Queens, Brooklyn, Brownsville, Long Island
            and Staten Island.
            This classification resulted from the assumption that descriptions made by rappers regarding the City, as
            well as the context in which these were used, were different from the ones of more precise neighborhoods. As
            for the sub-corpuses, they were separated as follows: very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very
            negative. Two categories were added to the previous calculations to add nuance the statements and make more
            topics appear.

            Analysis
          </h3>
          <p>
            The analysis of the texts allows us to differentiate several facets of rap. When the rappers mention a
            locality in New York, the range of topics is wide, and covers the most positive to the most negative of what
            we know of the rapper's background. To claim that the rapper only talks about money and drugs in his lyrics
            is therefore proven wrong by this analysis. A more detailed analysis of these texts allows us to know
            whether the rapper's imagination resembles the real conditions of the communities in question.

          </p>
          <p>
            There are four topics of society that we have profiled in the topics:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>The daily routine</h4>
              In which various topics of the rapper's life are clustered, from family, to neighborhood.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Music, the main income of the rapper</h4>
              Just like an average citizen participating in the working world as we know it, the rapper concentrates the
              majority of his time on producing music. The work of a rapper has many outlets, and is a profitable field
              for him and his entourage (management, branding, production, logistics, ...)
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>The love of the community, the neighborhood</h4>
              The MC is the first witness of the living condition of his community. He is also considered as a model of
              success, and can sometimes take the cut of benefactor of his neighborhood. He represents both a geographic
              space and often fringed communities in that seeks pride in rap competition.
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>The danger of the lifestyle/day routine</h4>
              As a reference, we can look at the important crime rate (murder, rape, assault, etc..) recorded in the
              Bronx and compare it to the average rate of the city of New York. The rate of Bronx is approximately 3
              times higher. The rappers experiencing it on a daily basis become field journalists, often witnesses of
              shocking events, and sometimes even the protagonists of this violence. Their songs and lyrics can often be
              understood as reports of what they live and see and become an important source of information.
              (<a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/bronx/crime#data">ref</a>)
            </li>

          </ul>

          Now that we have succeeded in identifying a range of topics discussed in rap, we can analyze geographically
          the variations of emotions applied to New York City neighborhoods.

            In these box plots, we can see that the imaginary communicated throughout the lyrics varies according to the
            localities mentioned. These graphs suggest that, according to the imaginary narrated by the artists, certain
            NY neighborhoods are talked about in a more positive way than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stereotype that is often associated to rap lyrics is that they are always rather negative and inciting
            violence. They become positive when the rapper conveys pride in being from the neighborhood he or she
            “praises”.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              "Free flowing and stomping!
              Never tip-toeing
              Overthrowing the comp
              Big up Bronx!"
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the quote stated above as an example, KRS-One glorifies the neighborhood he is from. This feeling of
            belonging expressed in the lyrics is a possible claim of unification in opposition to another possibly
            larger groupment, such as the rest of the city or the police for example. We can notice this innate
            opposition particularly in rap through its writing style. Other positive topics include the desire to grow
            as a family or the desire to grow financially.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              “You got a gat, you better find it
              And use that shit, think fast and get reminded
              Of robberies in Manhattan, you know what happened
              Sixty G's worth of gun clappin'”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast, we often find hints of hustle, illegal activities in negative sentences. The example stated
            above is one of the sentences pulling down Manhattan's score in Mobb Deep’s track Drop a Gem on ’Em.

          <p>

            One of the observations we can make on the heat map is that we notice a clear evolution from decade to
            decade in the way rappers sing about the neighborhood of Harlem. In fact, the borough got a very negative
            score in the 80s, but improves its positivity score through the decades. There are various possible
            explanations to this evolution.

          <h5>BEFORE BRUNCH, THERE WERE RIOTS</h5>

          The improvement of life in Harlem could be one of them. Over the sixties and seventies, Harlem experienced a
          series of severe crises. With many of its inhabitants fleeing poverty and riots resulting from the political
          climate and inequalities, in hopes to find a safer place with better infrastructure. The poorest and least
          educated population with no means nor will to leave however remained, living in a climate of perpetual
          tension. Statistics and testimonies from the 70s reflect the deterioration of living conditions in Harlem.
          But since 1980, efforts have been made to stop this crisis. Federal public funds have been distributed to
          revitalize northern Manhattan as with the "New York Empowerment Zone" in 1996. The objective being
          gentrification in the neighborhood to make Harlem attractive. Looking only at numbers, it was a successful
          bet because the crime rate has since then highly diminished in Harlem. One could however argue that a part
          of the authenticity and culture of the borough has also been lost, this is something we would have liked to
          notice in our results, we however were unable to draw such conclusions from our results.
          </p>
          <p>
          <h5>THE HORRORCORE RAP STYLE</h5>
          Another possible explanation of such a negative score in the 80s could be the ongoing rap lyrical movement at
          the time: the horrorcore rap style.
          Quoted above, Big L was one of the most influential artists of Harlem. He was born in 1974 in a Harlem deep in
          a social crisis. His lyrics are raw, and he is often credited to have been a part of the creation of
          horrorcore, a violent and dark style of rap in which people use graphic phrasing to talk about murder and
          violence. This wave disappeared after the 80s.

          <h5>THE LACK OF CITATIONS</h5>
          The data is pretty sparse for this decade.
