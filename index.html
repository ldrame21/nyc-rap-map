            As done by Moretti for the 19th century neighborhoods of London, a cartography of a city as it is depicted through litterature can teach us a lot about the feelings and connotations associated to it. In Morretti’s case, it allows him to notice a strong difference between the real London, crumbling under poverty and crime, and the one described in contemporary novels. Moretti’s study allowed him to map feelings associated to given places at given times. By applying a methodology similar to his’ to a 21th century topic of interest, with new tools and approaches, we were hoping to visually represent …  . In our case the city to cartography therefore became New York, as for the literature and novels, they became rap lyrics.
            <!--
                <strong>MeToo</strong>. Two words, a hashtag, a civil rights movement with tremendous impacts on our
            society. Everything starts on October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017, with a viral Twitter hashtag from Alyssa
            Milano. The movement, initially created by Tarana Burke, spread all over the world, inviting women to break
            silence on sexual harassment, violence, discrimination via social networks. The medias stepped in with
            widespread coverage and enhanced the movement's influence. Finally, women inequalities and the unsafe
            climate created by actors of society became a trending and polarizing topic on all media. Still, the
            question of the size of MeToo's impact outside the realm of social media is to be answered. By using the
            Quotebank <sup><a href=" #_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup> dataset from 2015 to 2020, we will
            investigate the significance of the movement's impact. -->

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            <it>
              “There are some who dismiss hip-hop as the dead letter of brazen stereotype-mongering among the severely
              undereducated and their gaggle of learned and over-interpreting defenders. Other critics claim that the
              deficits of hip-hop are amplified because they blare beyond the borders of ugly art to inspire youth to
              even uglier behavior. And others protest that, stripped of politics, history, and racial conscience,
              hip-hop is little more than sonic pathology that blasts away all the achievement of the civil rights
              struggle.”
            </it>
          </p>
          <p>
            Born between Harlem and the Bronx around the 70s from a mix of different cultures and art forms, hip hop is
            surprisingly rarely considered as a subject of scholarly studies. Indeed, since its apparition rap has often
            been criticized for corrupting the younger generations by twisting their ideals. By considering the inherent
            negativity of the genre as the translation of a harsh environment and understanding it in close relation to
            a context, we can understand rap as a mirror of the society. This is reflected in the speed at which it
            evolves and reacts to events of the actuality. It thus makes sense to use its lyrics as a reservoir from
            which to draw information specific to decades and boroughs.
          </p>
          <p>
            For his study mentionned above, Moretti proceeded to a large survey of sentiments associated with precise
            locations within London. All of his data was drawn from 15’000 lines of various types of books, written
            between 1’700 and 1’900. These were then associated to a score ranging from -1 to 1, with -1 being very
            negative to 1 being very positive.
            Basing our methodology on Moretti’s, we exchanged the books for a dataset constructed using lyrics from
            about a hundred of New York City’s hip hop artists. In the latter, artificial paragraphs consisting of three
            consecutive “lines” of their lyrics were created, in order to increase their contextualization and reduce
            false interpretations. We then proceeded to keep only the paragraphs which mentionned a place in New York
            City, resulting in a dataset containing a total of 3’200 paragraph.

            Topic Extraction
          </h3>
          <p>
            The chart presented above is a topic model created using TFidf. It was made to explore the different topics
            addressed in New Yorker rap lyrics in relation with different factors. The lyrics lines we started from were
            separated by lines, we therefore had to find a way to artificially create the different corpuses with
            specially distinct topics required to perform topic modelling using TFidf.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our first step was to separate the lines per neighborhood, in hopes that clusters describing New York
            boroughs would appear. The results were unfortunately not concluding as we couldn’t see nor understand any
            logic within the clusters. A probable explanation for this is that the topics of larger interest were
            recurrent in most of the neighborhoods, making them disappear through the TFidf method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first step was to separate the lines per neighborhood, in hopes that clusters describing New York

          </p>
          <p>
            The last and final step consisted of creating two main corpuses, each separated in five sub-corpuses. The
            first of the main corpuses contained lines related to New York City in general as well as the most famous
            locations in the city, such as Broadway or SoHo. The second main corpus aggregated lyrics precisely
            describing NYC neighborhoods, respectively the Bronx, Harlem, the Queens, Brooklyn, Brownsville, Long Island
            and Staten Island.
            This classification resulted from the assumption that descriptions made by rappers regarding the City, as
            well as the context in which these were used, were different from the ones of more precise neighborhoods. As
            for the sub-corpuses, they were separated as follows: very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very
            negative. Two categories were added to the previous calculations to add nuance the statements and make more
            topics appear.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Analysis
          </h4>
          <p>
            The analysis of the texts allows us to differentiate several facets of rap. When the rappers mention a
            locality in New York, the range of topics is wide, and covers the most positive to the most negative of what
            we know of the rapper's background. To claim that the rapper only talks about money and drugs in his lyrics
            is therefore proven wrong by this analysis. A more detailed analysis of these texts allows us to know
            whether the rapper's imagination resembles the real conditions of the communities in question.

            Ok! but what do these men have so much to talk about?
          </h3>
          <p>
            In order to find out, we trained a machine learning model with data coming from social media, namely Reddit,
            and tried to see how accurately this model can classify a sentence as mysoginistic or not. When testing it
            on Quotebank's subdatasets (Talking about women or metoo), we get a very low ratio of mysoginistic quotes to
            total quotes for both, with a slightly higher ratio when metoo is the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we had actually created was a detector of extremely sexist and rude quotes, since a couple of months
            would not be enough for us to perfect the model and make it detect subtle sexism, as this can be a project
            by itself. So it proves itself a little useful if we want to extract some sexist quotes on the fly as
            examples, such as:

          <h4>"That's all they do is bitch, moan, and complain... What happened to you today, sweetheart, did they
            not chill your rosé? Was the trolley not running down at the mall?" - Bill Burr</h4>
          <h4>"Feminism causes women to hate men, kill their children, become witches, whores & lesbians." - Alex
            Hall</h4>
          <h4>"I am a rapist now. I would never rape you because you do not deserve it… slut!" - Jair Bolsonaro</h4>
          </p>
          <h3>Running a sentiment analysis...</h3>
          <p>
            Analysing the variation of sentiment for different categories may lead to understanding the reaction the
            certain groups of people to the metoo movement, and how the overall sentiment around women changed. The
            sentiment analysis was run on both subdatasets, and we separated quotes by the speakers' gender and age. We
            also extracted the average sentiment around 2 key dates in the movement, the 15<sup>th</sup> of October
            (Date of initial tweet) and the 8<sup>th</sup> of March (women’s day).
          </p>

          <h4>
            Young people are more positive than old people.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            The subject of MeToo brings down the sentiment from clearly positive to neutral and slightly negative.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Middle aged and old men's sentiment pre (2015) and post (2019) metoo did not change. All women and younger
            men became more positive.

          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, 2015, when MeToo did not exist yet. The main words we see are related to family, and "sexual
            assault" and "domestic violence" appear in small.

          <p>
            Then, 2017, the year the movement was created. We see new terms appearing (e.g. "sexual harrassment",
            "sexual misconnduct"...). It is expected for such words and bigrams to blow up since we are at the peak at
            the movement and any other result would have been unexpected.

          <p>
            Finally, 2019, when the movement is supposed to be past its peak. The main words we see go back
            family-related ones, but now keywords related to MeToo are more existent than in 2015. It is a great result
            to see, because even though the main subject around women is back to where it was, we can see some influence
            that the movement had on the content of the quotes after 2017.

            Our findings coincide with an article made by the Economist, which can be found <a

            In the image below, the graph on the right shows how the mention of "sexual harrasment" peaked in news
            articles bewteen 2017 and 2018, and then the number of mentions dropped, but not to the same level as
            pre-2017

            What topics appear the most in the quotes?
          </h3>
          <p>
            With the help of NLP libraries, we extracted the main topics present in Quotebank, when the subject revolves
            around women. For this, tokenization and lemmatisation have been applied and we took into account both
            monograms and bigrams only. Some topics related to MeToo appear (e.g. Harvey Wienstein, sexual abuse,
            marriage equality...). This is indeed promising, and shows a certain influence of the movement. But it is
            not a statistically strong claim to say that MeToo had such a big impact that it became a full topic in of
            itself. The closest our clustering has come to is in cluster 8, where for &lambda = 0.85, we can infer a
            topic centered around men-women relations, where men can sometimes go too far.

          <h3>To Conclude...</h3>
          <p>
            Going back to our main question: Did MeToo have any impact on the place of women in media?
          </p>
          <p>
            The studies conducted above can lay a strong argument for the possibility that MeToo did have an influence.
            However, this has to be taken with a grain of salt. The rise in women speakers, the shift in sentiment, the
            slight change in word usage might be a result of what transpired in October 2017, but it could also be that
            these results, along with the explosion of the MeToo movement, are both caused by something outside the
            scope of our study and Quotebank.

            <h5>Quotebank dataset</h5>

            <p>
              The data explored in this story comes from the
              <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf"
                target="_blank">Quotebank
                dataset</a>.
              This dataset represents a collection of 178 million quotations from various English speaking news
              articles. Every quote has then been sanitized and analyzed by a machine learning model named Quobert,
              based on the NLP model BERT
              <sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">
                  [2]
                </a></sup>, developed by Google. Quotebank contains probabilities of potential speakers for each quote
              that was captured from 2008 to 2020.
              It is publicly available
              <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4277311" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h5>Data Exclusion Rules</h5>

            <p>
              Data included in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to certain data
              decisions. For the purposes of these analyses, the Quotebank dataset has been manipulated as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. The whole speaker-attributed dataset from 2008 to 2020 has size around 32.8 GB. This would be too much
              to handle to create a datastory at our scale. Also, the MeToo movement does not happen until the latter
              part of the 2010's, which means it would be a waste of memory and time to use all data since 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Since Quotebank assigns to a single quote different speakers with different degrees of certainty, the
              speaker with the highest probability is kept for the datastory, and the other speakers are discarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Quotebank sometimes attributes certain quotes to an "Unknown" speaker. The quote is discarded if
              "Unknown" is the only possibility. If there are multiple choices, the most certain <b>known</b> speaker is
              kept and the rest are discared.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. A large filtering of the quotes has been done. Since the story revolves around MeToo and the place of
              women in media, 2 subdatasets have been created with keywords-based filtering: <li> A subdataset
                representing quotes where women are mentioned or talked about.</li>
              <li>Another much smaller subdataset
                where only MeToo-related keywords were fed in order to obtain much more representative quotes towards
                the
                movement.</li>
            </p>
